Rest Api for a film rental company. Built with nodeJS Express Sequelize and MySQL


Reto Backend Movies. API

This project consists in creating a backend API which facilitates the ordering of films online

The user can search through a database and select a film, after creating a username and password to access the API

Technologies used:

● ES6

● NodeJs

● Express

● Sequelize

● Git

● Postman

● MySQL Workbench

Additionally, JSONWebToken and Bcrypt dependencies for nodeJS were used in order to encrypt the passwords of the users.

The structure of the API was as follows: First, I created the index.js document in order to define the PORT and server. Then i created the router.js document, and connected this to the views and controller folders. The controller folder contains the functions for each endpoint. Finally, the last step was to use sequelize to connect the code to the MySQL database and create the module and migration folders.
